# Axioms of Quantum Mechanics

Quantum Mechanics is built on 4 axioms (assumptions). These are well-verified by experiment, and took scientists a long time to discover and understand. In this notebook, our goal is to 
1. Learn what the 4 axioms of Quantum Mechanics are
2. Understand what they mean
3. Apply them to a simple model system: The Stern-Gerlach experiment

## The first Axiom: States are vectors

We can represent the state of a Quantum system as a vector in a Vectorspace. These vectors are always normalised, so they have length 1. One example of this is the state of a single spin, which can be visualized as an arrow pointing either up or down.

md"## The second Axiom: Observables are Hermitian Matrices

An observeable is a physical quantity that we can measure. Examples include the energy, the momentum, the position and the spin of a particle. Each such observeable can be represented by a hermitian matrix, which acts on the state vector. In our example of looking at spin states, one example would be the spin of the particle along the z axis, i.e. whether the spin is pointing up (1) or down (-1). This is represented by the matrix:"

# ╔═╡ 9bade9d9-2301-4f36-8809-344873f8630c

# ╔═╡ ba383896-1d2a-43a0-851b-4114891645be
md"The number that the state is multiplied by when the operator is applied is called an eigenvalue. What are the eigenvalues of $σ_z$? What happens when you apply the operator to a state that is not [1,0] or [0,1]?"

# ╔═╡ 2af78c44-2d26-486d-beb4-e6f1c425b393
md"We can imagine other matrices acting on the spin-state. These correspond to the spin in x-direction and y direction. The matrices are:"

# ╔═╡ d8cc41e8-fe7b-43e7-8123-359eb32c7380

md"Try what happens when you apply these matrices to the spin states [1,0] and [0,1]! 

This is because [1,0] and [0,1] are eigenstates of $σ_z$, but not of $σ_x$ or $σ_y$. The operator $σ_z$ asks the question: Is the spin up (returns 1 times the vector) or is it down (returns -1 times the vector). $σ_x$ and $σ_y$ ask whether the spin points forward or backward, and left or right respectively. So when given a vector pointing up or down, they don't give a simple answer. 

Which vectors are eigenstates of $σ_x$ and $σ_y$?"

md"## The third axiom: Measurements

Now that we have defined our state, and what we can measure for that state, the next question is what the result of a measurement will be. In the case of a spin-state [1, 0], if we measure the spin along the z-axis, we will of course get 1 as a result. Likewise, for [0,1], the result will be -1.

md"## Fourth Axiom of Quantum Mechanics: Time Evolution

We now understand how to specify a system, what we can measure and how to predict outcomes of measurements. The last piece of the puzzle is the *Time Evolution*, which predicts what the future state of a system will be, given its current state.

In order to understand this, we need to introduce one more concept: The **Hamiltonian**. This is the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system. In our example we can imagine an external magnetic field which is applied to the spin. If the spin is aligned with the magnetic field, its energy is smaller, e.g. -2. If it is pointing in the opposite direction, its energy is increased to +2. We assume that the magnetic field points in the z-direction. The Hamiltonian of the system then is"

md"Note that the Hamiltonian $H$ and the σ_z operator have the same eigenstates (Check that this is true!). This means that measuring either also fixes the result for measuring the other.

Since the full state including complex phases depends on 4 numbers it is difficult to imagine for us. However, a global complex phase, which is applied to the entire state $e^{i\phi} \Psi$, does not change the outcomes of measurements, so we can ignore it. All that remains is the relative complex phase between the entries, and the real magnitude of each entry of the vector.

Show that a global complex phase does not change the outcome of measurements!"

We can further reduce the dimensionality of the problem by noting that the normalisation to length 1 of the vector removes one more degree of freedom. Therefore, only two numbers are sufficient to characterize the state: 
 - The complex phase between the states
 - How much the state points in the z-direction"
